LESS for Kohana
===============

This module allows Kohana developers who like to use LESS syntax to easily
include the [lessphp library](http://github.com/leafo/lessphp) into their 
project and begin writing CSS with LESS right away. It is similar to the
[LESS module by mongeslani](http://github.com/mongeslani/kohana-less) but
simpler, and includes lessphp via a submodule.
